EXPERIENCE

<b>Founder and Software Development Engineer</b>  </br>
Advanced Soundware | Culver City, California | 03/2018 - Present (6 Years) 

<blockquote>
<b>Scope:</b> Conceived, developed, and launched the company’s flagship product while leading a cross-functional team of software engineers, audio editors, graphic designers, and studio musicians. </br>
<b>Accomplishments:</b> Conceptualized and developed a software system (end to end) to analyze music notation data (MIDI, MusicXML) and generate a multi-track audio file (WAV) representing a simulated performance of the input music by an orchestral brass ensemble, derived from hundreds of thousands of recorded performances of short music excerpts performed by brass musicians in a sound stage. I designed the system to analyze the music data looking for patterns of pitch, rhythm, dynamics, and other music attributes, which was used to match subsets of the music data to the recorded audio excerpts. The audio excerpts were further manipulated via pitch-shifting and time-stretching (DSP) to fit the exact specifications of the input music.
